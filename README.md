# The AI-Coding Revolution: Spec-Driven Development & Behavioral Engineering

_Beyond Prompt Engineering: Multi-Agent Orchestration with Behavioral Guardrails_

## The Problem

You ask AI to implement a feature. It produces plausible-looking code that completely misses e point. You iterate, clarify, prompt-engineer—and still, hallucinations cascade. Traditional coding achieves ~60% accuracy. You spend more time debugging AI output than writing it ourself.
**The question**: What if we designed AI as a disciplined team of specialists—each constrained by behavioral protocols, guardrails, and constantly peer-reviewing each other under the human supervision and mastery?

## The 5D-Wave Framework

The Double Loop in assisted MultiAgentic-AI coding:

| Wave    | Specialist Agent    | Output                                                           |
| ------- | ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| DISCUSS | Product Owner       | Structured specifications                                        |
| DESIGN  | Solution Architect  | Visual architecture decisions                                    |
| DISTILL | Acceptance Designer | Executable BDD scenarios                                         |
| DEVELOP | Software Crafter    | Outside-In ATDD implementation (following 6 internal loop steps) |
| DELIVER | DevOps Coordinator  | Production-ready, validated code                                 |

Each wave produces artifacts that become specification constraints for the next. No vague prompts; **every agent operates on validated specs**.

## The Secret Sauce: Adversarial Verification

Every specialist has a shadow reviewer:
- software-crafter ────► software-crafter-reviewer (Haiku)
- solution-architect ──► solution-architect-reviewer (Haiku)
- Cost-efficient second models that challenge outputs: "Does this test validate production behavior, or is it mock theater?" 
- Self-correcting loops catch hallucinations before they mpound.

## The Paradigm Shift

| Traditional AI Coding            | 5D-Wave Approach                                 |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Single agent, single prompt      | Orchestrated specialist team                     |
| Trust and verify later           | Continuous adversarial verification              |
| Code-first thinking              | Specification-first discipline                   |
| Human debugging AI output        | AI peer-reviewing AI output                      |
| ~60% accuracy                    | 95%+ specification compliance                    |
| Unpredictable behaviour          | Predictable, pre-defined behaviour               |
| Building software, not a product | Product specialist guiding creation from day one |

## Live Demo

Watch a real requirement flow through all 5 waves—from vague user story to production-ready architecture. You become the **Captain**: strategic oversight, not micro-management.
> "AI doesn't replace craftsmanship—it amplifies it. Discipline → excellent code. No discipline → st garbage."

## Speaker BIO

_The Story Behind This Talk_: In 2023, something clicked into place. Alessandro Di Gioia, and Marco Consolaro, joined forces with Michele Brissoni under the SW Craftsmanship Dojo. The Dojo exists because they share the same stubborn belief: socio-technical excellence isn't a nice-to-have, it's the foundation everything else rests on. Together they've taken their Software Craft Training programme to multiple countries and Fortune 100 organisations, using live remote Mob Programming as the core method. It's not a conventional approach, but that's precisely why it works. Thousands of software professionals have sharpened their skills through this programme, and what's emerged is something larger than training: a growing community of passionate crafters and a new generation of organisations that refuse to settle for mediocrity.

### Michele Brissoni

Born in the Dolomites of Italy, Michele's early discipline in martial arts and passion for speed found unexpected expression when a pivotal encounter with Ferrari Formula 1 during the Michael Schumacher era reshaped his perspective on IT—proving that the same principles winning world championships can drive elite software performance. Over the last two decades, Michele has pioneered frameworks redefining how organizations evolve in the software age. From Lean and Agile transformations to DevOps revolutions, his work has consistently pushed the boundaries of what's possible in software delivery. Today, Michele serves as Tech Advisor, CTO, and Board-Level Strategist, helping Fortune 500 enterprises, scale-ups, and investors move beyond transformation into true digital evolution. **My Mission**: Stop transforming, start evolving in the AI-native era.
